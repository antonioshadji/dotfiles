-- 		The result is a Number, which is the foldlevel of line {lnum}
-- 		in the current buffer.  For nested folds the deepest level is
-- 		returned.  If there is no fold at line {lnum}, zero is
-- 		returned.  It doesn't matter if the folds are open or closed.
-- 		When used while updating folds (from 'foldexpr') -1 is
-- 		returned for lines where folds are still to be updated and the
-- 		foldlevel is unknown.  As a special case the level of the
-- 		previous line is usually available.
-- 		{lnum} is used like with |getline()|.  Thus "." is the current
-- 		line, "'m" mark m, etc.
